# ZIPcord-cl

ZIPcord is the test version of Discord clone writen in C++.<br/>
I used Dear ImGui, Port Audio and winsock2 (tcp)<br/>

I havent compile .exe with all fonts file yet, but it will be fixed in next updates by using NSIS.<br/>

Some data about user will be located in C:/Program Files/ZIPcord, but i will make it later.<br/>

## Road map:
Optomization of client for low latency and perfomance<br/>
Server on pc of any user with out ddns and white IPv4<br/>
Data about user on his PC<br/>
Support of Russion lang<br/>
Volume control in voice chat<br/>
Add Servers (like in Discord) and Private chats<br/>
May be some activity (like mini games in Discord)<br/>
May be some custom interface colors <br/>
Add quoting text and replies (like in Telegram)<br/>
Add Icons for users and more account settings<br/>
Design for messages
