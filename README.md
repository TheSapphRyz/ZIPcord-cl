# ZIPcord-cl

ZIPcord is the test version of Discord clone writen in C++.
I used Dear ImGui, Port Audio and winsock2 (tcp)

I havent compile .exe with all fonts file yet, but it will be fixed in next updates by using NSIS.

Some data about user will be located in C:/Program Files/ZIPcord, but i will make it later.

Road map:
Optomization of client for low latency and perfomance
Server on pc of any user with out ddns and white IPv4
Include NSIS installation
Data about user on his PC
Support of Russion lang
Volume control im voice chat
Add Servers (like in Discord) and Private chats
May be some activity (like mini games in Discord)
